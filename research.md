### Presentations:

<p class="cn">Some past presentations that I have shared.</p>

* [Hack in The Box Amsterdam 2017 - I got 99 trends and a # is all of them](/assets/D1T1-Steven-Seeley-and-Roberto-Suggi-Liverani-I-Got-99-Trends-and-a-Shell-Is-All-Of-Them.pptx)

   <p class="cn">Roberto and I discussed how we found over 200+ Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities within Trend Micro Software.</p>

* [Hack in The Box Amsterdam 2012 - Ghost in the allocator](/assets/D2T2-Steven-Seeley-Ghost-In-the-Allocator.pdf)

   <p class="cn">Here I demonstrated a new technique/variation for exploitation against the Windows 7 heap manager that abuses the allocation offset mechanism. Additionally, I also presented a likely attack technique against the consumer preview version of the Windows 8 heap manager.</p>

* [Ruxcon 2012 - How to catch a chameleon](/assets/How-to-catch-a-chameleon-StevenSeeley-Ruxcon-2012.pdf)

   <p class="cn" markdown="1">This presentation was about the introduction of a plugin for Immunity Debugger that I developed called [heaper](https://github.com/stevenseeley/heaper) that is designed to not only detect a corrupted heap state before out-of-bounds memory access, but was also designed to detect exploitable conditions in past Windows operating systems.</p>
